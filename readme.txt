While something is selected, you can scale it with the mousewheel,
and drag it around to move it and it's children, while it maintains its
angle to its parent.

including the shape and colour.

Select the shape from the list of available shapesm, and select colour using
the java color selector.

You can add a child as an exact duplicate of it in the menu as well.
Initially, the child will be right on top of the parent.
Or remove the node and it's children.
